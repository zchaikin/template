## Take a Ride Learning a New Language
Learning a new language is always a challenging ride. Knowing multiple languages such as C/C++, and Java allows me to connect each language to one another and derive differences and similarities. Although knowing multiple languages certainly helps, the best way towards mastering a language comes with practice.

## Practice to Build a Solid Foundation
Beginning with the basics, JavaScript was very similar to Java, so the first portion of the freeCodeCamp was a fun review. However, the ES6 section is when content started becoming challenging. Problem by problem, I began to gain more confidence and understand the language and the many shortcuts. Developing a solid foundation allowed me to click with the language and regain optimal pace within the ES6 exercises.

## Finding a Rhythm
After experiencing even more JavaScript with the WODs, I found the language fun. I enjoy challenging my coding in a race against time. The feeling of high-stakes pressure gives me a chance to find a rhythm with the language and never look back. Achieving the time goal reflects my connection and efficiency with the language and proves very satisfying.

## The Ups and Downs of the Rollercoaster 
In all, my experience as I learn JavaScript is comparable to a rollercoaster. At first, problems were easy but slowly built towards an incline as time went on. Practicing and learning the shortcuts and various features of JavaScript helped me reduce that incline and go back to coasting downhill. Even though I know I will be back on that incline as problems become more complex, the tools I have and continue to build on will reduce my time on the uphill and more time on the downhill slopes.

## Another Tool in the Toolbox
I recommend learning JavaScript. The language offers many exclusive features and shortcuts unique to the language. You can easily hop into JavaScript if you are a beginner, and I enjoy that you can use it via multiple platforms such as your computer or phone. The language is constantly evolving and is one of the most popular languages. Having JavaScript in your toolbox will only help you and provide a powerful tool.
