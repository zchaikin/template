## Where to Begin
Software Engineering provides countless learning points and knowledge to take with you once the course comes to an end. The pedagogy for the class Athletic Software Engineering creates an environment that may seem high-stakes with the WODs (Workout of the Day), but after practice, you realize it is more similar to stretching than a high-stakes game. In all, the class gives a chance for you to spread your wings and fly. Where you go is up to you.

## Agile Project Management
Agile project management is a developmental process aimed at efficiently finishing your project. Implementing agile project management broke down the final project into milestones (3). Instead of having set due dates, breaking down into multiple milestones gave mini deliverables allowing the final project always to have something to show. Organizing in issue-driven project management (agile project management technique) is an approach where you sort every issue into mini-tasks within a milestone. In my opinion, this made the project so much more organized and as a group, everybody could break off and work on their issue. Group projects can often get disorganized, although there were a lot of issues, this is a great procedure to follow to give everybody a task to do and break down the project into pieces. The agile approach is something I will be using for future projects.

## Coding Standards
Coding standards are a necessity for software engineers. For ICS 314, we were using ESLint, and at first, the red squiggly lines came with much frustration. However, after becoming familiar with it, I quickly understood how to avoid the red squiggly lines altogether. Garnering a green checkmark and being able to keep a constant standard is important. Especially in group settings where collaboration is key, everyone needs a standard set so members can always be on the same page. Coding standards, standards you name it are essential for anyone's future and are a constant thing I want to set and exceed as I go to the future.

## Where to Next
Software Engineering gave me valuable information to take with me in the future. Not to mention it also gave me more insight into what I want to do. I enjoy coding and this class was very fulfilling.
