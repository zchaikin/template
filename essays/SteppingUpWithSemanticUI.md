## Starting Simple
Starting simple, we used raw HTML and CSS as basic building blocks. For these assignments, the aesthetic is a bit out of date and out of touch for these times. Regardless, Raw HTML and CSS are still powerful, but venturing into more complex designs is where you can see there are limitations. There is always a time and place for Raw HTML and CSS to work efficiently and effectively. However, when using a system such as Semantic UI, there feels as if there is no limit on what you can achieve.

## Leveling Up
Semantic UI takes you to a new level on what you can do, but at a cost. This cost comes with learning anything new but makes it worth it in the end. Like any other programing language, there is a time spent getting accustomed to it and understanding it. Thankfully, we have a great how-to guide to navigate this new language. The documentation for Semantic UI is a great help to figure out any questions you have and provides source code as examples to understand how it works. The navigation through Semantic UI can help improve your skills and knowledge by upgrading the programming language to more complex designs.

## My Thoughts
Semantic UI has been great to me, but of course, not without struggles. Without the documentation, I would become lost since there are so many features. However, as you get used to Semantic UI and its documentation, you learn to navigate within it to find what you are looking to accomplish. At first, looking at websites and trying to replicate them seemed far-fetched because I was not used to Semantic UI. After learning to use the documentation to my advantage, I now feel confident in using my knowledge of Semantic UI to accomplish the goal of replicating a website. Whatever I do not know how to approach, I can use the documentation to help achieve it.

## Worth It
Raw HTML and CSS are a perfect first step and get the job done for more retro or simple websites. Unfortunately, in comparison to Semantic UI, Raw HTML and CSS are too limiting. Semantic UI is where you can take off to the next level and far exceed Raw HTML and CSS. Yes, a learning curve is involved, but all worth it if you want to go from web pages from this (Raw HTML) to this (Semantic UI).
