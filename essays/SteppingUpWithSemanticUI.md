## Starting Simple
Starting simple, we used raw HTML and CSS. For these assignments, the aesthetic is a bit out of date and touch for these times. Raw HTML and CSS are powerful, but venturing into more complex designs is where you see the limitations. There is a time and place for Raw HTML and CSS, but when using Semantic UI, there feels as if there is no limit on what you can achieve. 

## Leveling Up
Semantic UI takes you to a new level on what you can do, but at a cost. Just like any other programing language, there is a learning curve. Thankfully, we have a great how-to guide to navigate this new language. The documentation for Semantic UI is a great help to figure out any questions you have and provides source code as examples to understand how it works.

## My Thoughts
Semantic UI has been great to me, but of course, not without struggles. Without the documentation, I would become lost since there are so many features. However, as you get used to Semantic UI and its documentation, you learn to navigate within it to find what you are looking to accomplish. At first, looking at websites and trying to replicate them seemed far-fetched because I was not used to Semantic UI. After learning to use the documentation to my advantage, I now feel confident in using my knowledge of Semantic UI to accomplish the goal of replicating a website. Whatever I do not know how to approach, I can use the documentation to help achieve it.

## Worth It
Raw HTML is a great first step and gets the job done for more retro or simple websites, but pairing it with Semantic UI is where you can take off to the next level. Yes, a learning curve is involved, but all worth it if, you want to go from web pages from this (Raw HTML) to this (Semantic UI), then this is for you!
