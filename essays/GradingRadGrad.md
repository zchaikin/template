## Before RadGrad

Most students beginning their journey towards a college degree are unsure of the road ahead of them. In the constantly-expanding field of Computer Science, there are so many possibilities for you. However, as great as the many options are, they can become quite overwhelming. Seemingly endless questions can arise during your degree (what classes do I take, what do I want to do once I graduate, etc.). Luckily UH ICS students have access to a RadGrad that can answer your questions all in one spot.

## First Impression

I got a chance in my first semester to experience RadGrad. In my initial impression of RadGrad, I was unsure of its purpose and confused all around. Throughout this module, I was able to grasp the intent of RadGrad. Returning, years later, I see there is a noticeable improvement upon RadGrad. 

## Do the Tutorial!

Finishing the RadGrad New User tutorial allowed me to see what the program offers, rather than logging in and being overwhelmed. There is a lot to do within RadGrad, and I have found it a helpful tool. Here, you have access to numerous ICS-related interests, careers, courses, and opportunities. Choosing specific ICS topics allows you to see the different courses offered at UH relating to your desired interest. You will find yourself getting lost (in a good way) on the site, adding more and more to your profile, and planning for the future.

## RadGreat!

RadGrad will allow you to have a better degree experience and open your eyes to all possibilities. As a student who was once unsure where to begin within ICS, it helps filter and hone in where you want to specialize in ICS. Usually, students would be searching various media for all these ICS answers and opportunities, but thanks to RadGrad, they are all localized together. Which in turn makes the student experience much easier and more enjoyable. RadGrad helps direct, plan, and prepare you for the future, all while alleviating the stress of all the ICS questions you have and where you want to go once you graduate.
