## Evolutions and Flashbacks
From a young age, I found a connection with technology. There's always something new, simply put, the growth and advancement of technology are exponential, and that's exciting. Often people are in awe of the groundbreaking tech, but I always found myself going the next step to see what makes that run. Seeing the inner components inspires me to create ideas to solve everyday problems.

## Previous Experience and Future Goals
After coding in previous classes, I have never learned about the little things that make all the difference. Software Engineering will finally give me a chance to learn the formalities I have been missing. I have been looking forward to this course. I await the future challenges to reach my goal of becoming efficient with coding. In addition to becoming efficient, I hope to gain more proficiency in the design aspect of software engineering.

## Completing the Puzzle 
My dreams require software engineering to add another piece to the puzzle to achieve a complete build towards a B.S. in Computer Science. Software and tech give a chance to help a lot of people. This is something that resonates with me. Although I have various passions, the best feeling is making life easier for someone. Whether that's designing and coding a game to help someone escape the pressures of a world, solving a problem, etc., this is where the real gold is.
