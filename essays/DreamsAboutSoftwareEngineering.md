From a young age, I found a connection with technology. There's always something new, simply put, the growth and advancement of technology are exponential, and that's exciting. Often people are in awe of the groundbreaking tech, but I always found myself going the next step to see what makes that run. Seeing the inner components inspires me to create my ideas to solve everyday problems.

After coding in previous classes, Software Engineering will finally give me a chance to learn the formalities I have been missing. I have been looking forward to this course. I await the future challenges to reach my goal of becoming efficient with coding. In addition to becoming efficient, I hope to gain more proficiency in the design aspect of software engineering.

My dreams require software engineering to solve the puzzle of life I am building. Software and tech give a chance to help a lot of people. This is something that resonates with me. Although I have various passions, the best feeling is making life easier for someone. Whether that's designing and coding a game to help someone escape the pressures of a world, solving a problem, etc., this is where the real gold is.
