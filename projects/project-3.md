Put on your VR headset and be transported into a room full of zombies. All you have is an axes and a gun to fend off the horde. Using Unity and the help of teammates Weihang Mai, and Deshay Clemons, we created an up close survival experience perfectly fit for VR. Check out our game trailer!

<hr>
ICS 486 (Augmented and Virtual Reality Programming) was my first time using Unity, and building a video game from scratch. The process of making the game was hot and cold. One minute you would have a presentable game, while the next it would be compiling errors of all kinds. I found myself creating multiple scripts for the zombies to move towards the player and spawn around the map while also collaborating with teammates resolving errors that would pop up at a moments notice. Creating a working game with teammates was very fun and an exciting new passion for me.
