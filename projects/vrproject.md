Put on your VR headset and be transported into a room full of zombies. All you have is axes and a gun to fend off the horde. Using Unity and the help of teammates Weihang Mai and Deshay Clemons, we created an up-close survival experience perfectly fit for VR. Check out our gameplay trailer! [Team 6 VR Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vA-BxFFWGI).

ICS 486 (Augmented and Virtual Reality Programming) was my first time using Unity and building a video game from scratch. The process of making the game was hot and cold. One minute you would have a presentable VR game, while the next would be compiling errors of all kinds. My contributions to the project include creating multiple scripts for the zombies to move towards the player and spawn around the map, not to mention collaborating with teammates to resolve errors that would pop up at a moment's notice. Collaborating to create a working VR game was an exciting discovery of a new passion.
