## Game Summary
Put on your VR headset and be transported into a room full of zombies. All you have is axes and a gun to fend off the horde. Survive as long as you can, and pick up powerups to prolong your survival. Using Unity and the help of teammates Weihang Mai and Deshay Clemons, we created an up-close survival experience perfectly fit for VR. Check out our gameplay trailer!

## The VR Experience
ICS 486 ((Virtual & Augmented Reality Programming)) was my first time using Unity and building a VR video game from scratch. The process of making the game was hot and cold. One minute you would have a presentable VR game, while the next would be compiling errors of all kinds. Testing in VR was the most repetitive process since it required putting on and taking off the VR goggles. My contributions to the project include creating multiple scripts for the zombies to move toward the player and spawn around the map, not to mention collaborating with teammates to resolve errors that would pop up at a moment's notice. Collaborating to create a working VR game was an exciting discovery of a new passion.
