## Game Summary:
The Corrupt Forrest is a story 2D platformer where you are a Meerkat trying to resolve the corruption from a mysterious source. Jump and use platforms to avoid enemy attacks, and use various powerups as you complete each level. Using Unity and the help of teammates Jeffery Wood and Dominic Buoni, we created a fun story game that you can play infinitely. Check out our gameâ€™s website, where you can see the process to build the game, along with the trailer! [The Corrupt Forest Website](https://noclueteamuh.itch.io/noclueproject).

## The 2D Experience
ICS 485 (Video Game Design) was my first time using Unity to design and build a 2D platformer video game and using collaborative project management sites such as Miroboard, and Trello board. Using previous experience from my AR and VR projects I could better navigate how to solve errors. By using the project management sites, all team members knew what we were doing and what was left to do. My contributions to the project include designing all levels of the map, platform interaction with the player, and helping with the random room generation to ensure every time you play the game you would have a new experience. Upon completing the game, I find this to be the most satisfying of my video game projects and also the closest to a market-ready game.
