## Game Summary:
All you need is a card for this game to work! When developing the AR game, COVID-19 was a big unknown. Together, teammates Weihang Mai and Deshay Clemons created an AR game to take out our frustrations on COVID-19 that completely uprooted the world in an instance. Achieve high scores by spraying disinfectant to kill the virus while avoiding the virus as it comes towards you, and make sure to collect those powerups along the way. Check out the gameplay trailer here: [Team 6 AR Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgysvi5wWYg).

## The 2D Experience
ICS 485 (Video Game Design) was my first time using Unity to design and building a 2D platformer video game and using collaborative project management sites such as Miroboard, Trelloboard. Using previous experience from my AR and VR projects I could better navigate how to solve errors. By using the project management sites, all team members knew what we were doing and what was left to do. My contributions to the project include designing all levels of the map, platform interaction with the player, and helping with the random room generation to ensure everytime you play the game you would have a new experience. Upon completing the game, I find this to be the most satisfying of my video game projects and also the closest to a market ready game.
